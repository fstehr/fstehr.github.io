                            <p class="description">My favorite magazine. They have long-read articles on almost anything you can imagine.
                                It's one of the core outlets of the progress studies movement,
                                which tries to understand the barriers to progress and how to overcome them.
                                For shorter reads, I also recommend their newsletter, which offers original content distinct
                                from the magazine articles. Articles span:

                    <h3>Books</h3>

                            <p class="description">I mostly prefer to read novels, but once in a while, a non-fiction book
                                captures my attention. The list below includes books I’ve read recently that touched me in
                                some way and expanded my horizons (in no particular order). If you have any book recommendations
                                based on this list, please get in touch!</p>

                            <ul class="list">
                                <li>Hannah Ritchie: <em>Not the End of the World: How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet</em> – An optimistic outlook on all the things we have achieved already in fighting climate change and how we can achieve even more.</li>
                                <li>All books by Florian Illies – A German art historian with an excellent writing style; his books read like novels.
                                    I especially enjoyed <em>1913: The Year Before the Storm</em>, and <em>Love in a Time of Hate: Art and Passion in the Shadow of War</em>.</li>
                                <li>James Baldwin – To me, he is one of the greatest writers and observers of human nature. His prose is both direct and poetic. I especially enjoyed <em>Another Country</em>, and <em>Giovanni's room</em>.</li>
                                <li> Gabriele Tergit's <em>Effingers</em> – The story of a Jewish dynasty’s rise and fall in Berlin, beginning with the rush of the Gründerzeit period and ending tragically after WWII. A compelling account of lived experiences, family dynamics across generations, and their intersection with political tides.</li>
                                <li>Grit Lemke <em>Kinder von Hoy</em> – A vivid depiction of growing up in a small industrial town in GDR.</li>
