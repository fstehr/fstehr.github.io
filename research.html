                    <p>Dodging High Impact Behavior with Motivated Beliefs?

                    <p class="abstract">
                        I study the role of impact beliefs in explaining why many people adopt low impact
                        other-regarding behaviors, while only few people engage in high-impact behaviors.
                        Using an online experiment, I test the explanatory power of two potential cognitive mechanisms.
                        First, I propose that motivated impact beliefs might serve as a justification to only adopt
                        low impact behaviors. In particular, I hypothesize that people overestimate impact of low cost
                        behaviors, while underestimating the impact of high cost behaviors. Second, I hypothesize that
                        people only vaguely think about impact of their behaviors, and rather rationalize their choices
                        ex post. In line with a self-serving interpretation, I find that subjects on average slightly
                        overestimate low impacts and underestimate high impacts. Beliefs are, however, robust to changes
                        in incentives. Neither higher incentives for accuracy, nor changes in prices of donation affect
                        beliefs. Reducing scope for ex post rationalization by eliciting beliefs before donation choices
                        does not affect beliefs, but makes it more likely that subjects maximize impact by donating
                        to both projects. Taken together this suggests that besides motivated beliefs, complexity of
                        integrating impact and cost information may play a role in the low adoption levels of high
                        impact behaviors.

                <p>Making Up for Harming Others - An Experiment on Voluntary Compensation Behavior <br>

                <p class="abstract">
                    We investigate in a controlled laboratory setting if and to what extent buyers are willing to offset
                    negative real-world externalities that their purchasing decisions create. In one set of treatments,
                    the externality associated with a purchase is irreversible, whereas in another set of treatments,
                    buyers are offered the possibility to voluntarily compensate for the externality. The other set
                    of treatment variations refers to the matching of buyers and third parties, inducing diffusion of
                    harm among third parties or diffusion of responsibility among buyers. <br>
                    We find that subjects are on average willing to compensate for the externalities they create,
                    and that compensation decisions are sensitive to the surplus from buying. Yet, experimental
                    buyers are highly heterogeneous, and some of them never compensate. Overall, while the
                    introduction of voluntary compensation significantly reduces the harm created by consumption,
                    the net externality still remains high across all treatments. In particular, diffused responsibility
                    among buyers reduces the amounts paid for compensation and leads to larger overall net
                    externalities compared to the case without diffusion. At the same time, diffusion of the harm
                    among third parties does not significantly change compensation choices and externalities.

                <p>Hotelling Revisited - The Price-then-Location Model<br>

                <p class="abstract">
                    This paper analyzes a two-stage game in which two firms first choose prices and then locations
                    on the Hotelling line. Each consumer picks their supplier depending on the price difference and
                    distance to their location. We derive the subgame-perfect equilibrium for moderate differences
                    in production cost. At equilibrium, firms choose pure strategies at the price stage and mix in
                    terms of location, with the more efficient firm locating closer to the middle of the Hotelling
                    line. For identical production cost, any subgame perfect equilibrium involves mixing on the
                    price stage.
