                <p>Making Up for Harming Others - An Experiment on Voluntary Compensation Behavior <br>

                <p class="abstract">
                    We investigate in a controlled laboratory setting if and to what extent buyers are willing to offset
                    negative real-world externalities that their purchasing decisions create. In one set of treatments,
                    the externality associated with a purchase is irreversible, whereas in another set of treatments,
                    buyers are offered the possibility to voluntarily compensate for the externality. The other set
                    of treatment variations refers to the matching of buyers and third parties, inducing diffusion of
                    harm among third parties or diffusion of responsibility among buyers. <br>
                    We find that subjects are on average willing to compensate for the externalities they create,
                    and that compensation decisions are sensitive to the surplus from buying. Yet, experimental
                    buyers are highly heterogeneous, and some of them never compensate. Overall, while the
                    introduction of voluntary compensation significantly reduces the harm created by consumption,
                    the net externality still remains high across all treatments. In particular, diffused responsibility
                    among buyers reduces the amounts paid for compensation and leads to larger overall net
                    externalities compared to the case without diffusion. At the same time, diffusion of the harm
                    among third parties does not significantly change compensation choices and externalities.

                <p>Dodging High Impact Behavior with Motivated Beliefs?
                <span class="link non-active">[Working Paper Coming Soon]</span>
                </p>

                <p class="abstract">
                    Private households are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions,
                    rendering individual behavior crucial in the combat against climate change. However,
                    while a growing number of individuals engage in pro-environmental behavior, they often
                    focus on behaviors with little impact. Even the most pro-environmental individuals
                    rarely adopt actually impactful behaviors (Diekmann and Preisend√∂rfer, 2003), which leaves large untapped
                    potential for individuals to adopt more effective behaviors. The aim of this project is
                    to understand why so few people engage in high-impact behaviors. Using an online experiment,
                    I test the explanatory power of two potential cognitive mechanisms. First, I propose that
                    motivated impact beliefs might serve as a justification to only adopt low impact behaviors.
                    In particular, I hypothesize that people over-estimate impact of low cost behaviors, while
                    under-estimating the impact of high cost behaviors. Second, I test whether complexity in
                    incorporating noisy cost and impact information could explain the frequency of high-impact
                    behaviors. In line with a self-serving interpretation, I find that subjects on average
                    slightly over-estimate the impact of low-cost donations and under-estimate the impact of
                    high-cost donations. Neither higher incentives for accuracy nor forcing subjects to think
                    about impact before donating affects beliefs. Forcing people to think about impact first
                    does change donation patterns though, making it more likely that subjects maximize impact
                    by donating to both projects. This suggests that besides motivated beliefs, difficulty in
                    integrating impact and cost information drives the low adoption levels of high impact behaviors.
