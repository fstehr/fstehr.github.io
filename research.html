                <p>Making Up for Harming Others - An Experiment on Voluntary Compensation Behavior <br>
                    <span class="coauthors">(with Peter Werner)</span>
                </p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    We study to what extent consumers forego personal gains to avoid or reduce the harm their
                    choices impose on others. In the absence of regulation, such voluntary compensation provides
                    a way for consumers to internalize negative externalities on their own. However, the tangibility
                    of consumption externalities is often reduced by diffusion of both the harm created and the
                    responsibility in creating the externality. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate how
                    the presence of diffusion affects voluntary compensation. We find that subjects are generally
                    willing to compensate at least some of the harm their consumption creates for other subjects.
                    Diffused responsibility for the externality, however, reduces compensation levels and leads to
                    larger overall net externalities as compared to a baseline condition without diffusion. Diffusion
                    of the harm caused by consumption, on the other hand, does not change compensation choices
                    and externalities. Overall, while the introduction of voluntary compensation reduces the harm
                    created by consumption, the net externality still remains high across all treatments.
