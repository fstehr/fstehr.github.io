                <p>Making Up for Harming Others - An Experiment on Voluntary Compensation Behavior <br>

                <p class="abstract">
                    We study to what extent consumers forego personal gains to avoid or reduce the harm their
                    choices impose on others. In the absence of regulation, such voluntary compensation provides
                    a way for consumers to internalize negative externalities on their own. However, the tangibility
                    of consumption externalities is often reduced by diffusion of both the harm created and the
                    responsibility in creating the externality. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate how
                    the presence of diffusion affects voluntary compensation. We find that subjects are generally
                    willing to compensate at least some of the harm their consumption creates for other subjects.
                    Diffused responsibility for the externality, however, reduces compensation levels and leads to
                    larger overall net externalities as compared to a baseline condition without diffusion. Diffusion
                    of the harm caused by consumption, on the other hand, does not change compensation choices
                    and externalities. Overall, while the introduction of voluntary compensation reduces the harm
                    created by consumption, the net externality still remains high across all treatments.

                <p>Dodging High Impact Behavior with Motivated Beliefs?
                <span class="link non-active">[Working Paper Coming Soon]</span>
                </p>

                <p class="abstract">
                    Other-regarding behavior has been researched for decades. Still, there is no consensus on when
                    people show other-regarding behavior and when they don't. For example, the literature has
                    documented that people like to find excuses not to donate. This is however at odds with the
                    large amounts of money and time that are voluntarily donated each year, including to low
                    impact charities. In this paper, I test whether these observations can be reconciled by accounting for the cost
                    sensitivity of potential donors using an online experiment. First, I propose that many people
                    do indeed like to donate, but only as long as it is relatively inexpensive. Second, I propose that
                    motivated beliefs about the impact of donations facilitate the tradeoff between the benefit to
                    oneself and the benefit to the recipient. In line with a self-serving interpretation, I find that
                    subjects on average over-estimate the impact of low-cost donations and under-estimate the impact
                    of high-cost donations. Neither higher incentives for accuracy nor forcing
                    subjects to think about impact before donating affects beliefs. Forcing people to think about impact
                    first does change donation patterns though, making it more likely that subjects maximize impact by
                    donating to both projects.
