                    <h3>Trying to Do Good More Effectively</h3>

                        <p>
                            We often strive to do good things, but neglect areas where our doing good could have a much greater impact.
                            I am not a radical Effective Altruist, but I find some of their core considerations quite helpful
                            in thinking about my donations: (1) we have little intuitive feeling for the variation in impact across charities;
                            (2) it makes sense to “think on the margin” (i.e., like an economist) about impact – asking, where can my donation
                            move the needle the most? I found the first two chapters of the Effective Altruism Handbook a good introduction
                            to start thinking about this.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Innovation for the Social Good</h3>

                        <p>Lots of progress for vulnerable groups is held back by a lack of innovation, often because
                            innovators don't see the business case. To me, this is where economists with an inclination for
                            both theory and data can come into play. They can focus on carefully designing innovation
                            financing tools that address these market failures. I like this design-thinking work, at the intersection between research and policy,
                            which is sometimes called market shaping. Using economists' tools to make the world a better
                            place brings together everything I care about, and is something we should pursue much more actively.

                    <h3>Increasing People’s Agency & Aspirations</h3>

                        <p>One bottleneck for talent utilization that I've become increasingly aware of through my teaching
                            and mentoring of students is a lack of confidence and perceived agency. I have decidedly become
                            an optimist and try to enable others to think similarly – raising their aspirations and agency,
                            showing them that one can often simply take action. I mostly like it because it is fun to support
                            others in pursuing their passions, but it is also a very scalable meta-skill. Related readings include:

                    <h3>Human-centered Architecture</h3>

                        <p>Affordable housing is a big problem in the western world. We are still not building
                            enough, and more importantly, we're often building badly. I believe good architecture and
                            urban planning should put people and their needs at the center. They should not only aim for
                            affordability, but also aesthetic quality and fostering joyful human interaction.
                            Scandinavian functionalist design masters this skillfully, and I love its aesthetic – natural light,
                            organic shapes, and the use of local materials, especially plain wood. There are plenty of examples showing
                            that practicality and beauty don’t have to be in conflict, and they should inspire how we build today.
                            Here are some recommendations:

                    <h3>Living Well in a Tech-Filled World</h3>

                        <p>I like to be intentional about how I spend my time: I don’t have social media apps on my phone,
                            and I try to streamline my algorithms to prioritize economics research discussions, content
                            that helps me learn new things, and wholesome human interactions :) I also like to write by hand (paper or ipad);
                            it helps clarify my thinking, and I strongly believe it strengthens the connection between
                            writing and memory. Outside of work, I enjoy everything related to arts and culture – going to
                            concerts, visiting museums, biking, and traveling by train.
